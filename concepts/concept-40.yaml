    There are three manifestations of characters in PDF, depending on context:

    * A PDF file is represented as a sequence of 8-bit bytes, some of which are interpreted as
    character codes in the ASCII character set and some of which are treated as arbitrary binary
    data depending upon the context.
    * The contents (data) of a string or stream object in some contexts are interpreted as character
    codes in the PDFDocEncoding, UTF-8 or UTF-16BE character set.
    * The contents of a string within a PDF content stream in some situations are interpreted as
    character codes that select glyphs to be drawn on the page according to a character encoding
    that is associated with the text font.
