            There are three manifestations of characters in PDF, depending on
            context:


            * A PDF file is represented as a sequence of 8-bit bytes, some of
            which are interpreted as

            character codes in the ASCII character set and some of which are
            treated as arbitrary binary

            data depending upon the context.


            * The contents (data) of a string or stream object in some contexts
            are interpreted as character

            codes in the PDFDocEncoding, UTF-8 or UTF-16BE character set.


            * The contents of a string within a PDF content stream in some
            situations are interpreted as

            character codes that select glyphs to be drawn on the page according
            to a character encoding

            that is associated with the text font.
