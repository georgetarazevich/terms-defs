    PDF Conformance Levels are represented by letter designators with a PDF ISO
    subset acronym, such as PDF/A-1b, PDF/A-4e, PDF/X-5pg, PDF/VT-2s. Each
    Conformance Level relates to a specialized definition in the corresponding
    PDF ISO subset with its own very specific set of rules and requirements. For
    example, PDF/A-4 is the PDF-for-archival standard supporting PDF 2.0, with
    PDF/A-4e being a highly specialized refinement of PDF/A-4 supporting
    engineering workflows with 3D content (hence the "e" designator) while
    PDF/A-2b (basic) and PDF/A-2u (Unicode) differ in requirements related to
    Unicode text extraction capabilities.  Not all PDF ISO subsets use
    conformance levels.
