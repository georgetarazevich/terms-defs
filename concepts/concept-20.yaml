  definition: "As documents can be long with many pages, humans have invented conventions to label pages more descriptively to assist with navigation. We are used to seeing front matter labelled with Roman numerals: i, ii, iii, iv, etc.; appendices prefixed with uppercase letters such as A.1, A.2, etc. or even chapter/page combinations such as 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2. In PDF terminology this is what is referred to as a page label - an optional descriptive label of a page that is commonly presented on-screen. This is in contrast to the\_integer page index\_used internally in PDF files."
