    Annex O in ISO 32000-2 defines PDF-specific fragment identifiers that can be
    added to the end of URLs that provide anchors to specific content or
    influence the display of a linked PDF file. Fragment identifiers are defined
    by the W3C and appear after the # symbol in a URL. A simple example is that
    a URL can refer to a specific page in a PDF by appending page=n (where n
    starts from 1) to a URL:
