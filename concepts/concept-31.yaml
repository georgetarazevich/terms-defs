  definition: Rolemaps are a core Tagged PDF concept that allows any structure type
    to be conceptually mapped between namespaces in a manner that enables all PDF
    processors to understand the basic intention of structure types. For example,
    a custom structure type called Foo might be rolemapped to a paragraph in the standard
    structure namespace, indicating that semantically Foo is "best matched" as a paragraph.
    Rolemaps thus support the use of custom structure types in PDF. Rolemaps and their
    use are described in clause 14.7 Logical structure and clause 14.8 Tagged PDF
    in ISO 32000.
