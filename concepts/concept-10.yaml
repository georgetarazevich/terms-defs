    PDF supports both interactive and non-Interactive forms. For technical
    details see clause 12.7 in ISO 32000-2:2020. Interactive forms were
    introduced in PDF 1.2 as a collection of fields for gathering information
    interactively from the user and are sometimes referred to as "AcroForms". A
    PDF document may contain any number of fields appearing on any combination
    of pages, all of which make up a single, global interactive form spanning
    the entire document. Arbitrary subsets of these fields can be imported or
    exported from the document as FDF or XFDF. Non-interactive forms (introduced
    in PDF 1.7) are a static representation of form fields. Such forms may have
    originally contained interactive fields such as text fields and radio
    buttons but were converted into non-interactive PDF files, they may
    represent form fields and/or data converted from external sources, or they
    may have been designed to be printed out and filled in manually.
