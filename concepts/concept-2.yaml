  definition: Annotations are a special PDF feature most commonly associated with
    commenting and reviewing a document, such as highlighting text, text strikethrough,
    or sketching on top of a document. However PDF 2.0 defines 28 different kinds
    of annotations which provide a far richer feature set including URLs (Link annotations),
    watermarks, form widgets, interactive 3D content, redaction, sound, movies and
    other rich media. For technical details see clause 12.5 in ISO 32000-2:2020.
