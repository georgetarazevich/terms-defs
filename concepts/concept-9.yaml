    Forms Data Format is a specialized file format, expressed in the same COS
    syntax that PDF uses, used for interactive form data that was introduced in
    PDF 1.2. FDF can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving
    the response, and incorporating it into the interactive form. It can also be
    used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be stored,
    transmitted electronically, and imported back into the corresponding PDF
    interactive form. In addition, beginning in PDF 1.3, FDF can be used to
    define a container for annotations that are separate from the PDF document
    to which they apply. For technical details see clause 12.7.8 of ISO
    32000-2:2020.
