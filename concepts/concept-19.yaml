  definition: Optical Character Recognition is the process of recognizing text from
    an image (photo) of text. It is typically referenced in relation to scan-to-PDF
    functionality. The accuracy of OCR results can vary depending on the quality of
    the page image and other factors. PDF does not constrain or limit OCR accuracy
    in any way.
