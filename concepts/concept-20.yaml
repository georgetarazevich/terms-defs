  definition: 'As documents can be long with many pages, humans have invented conventions
    to label pages more descriptively to assist with navigation. We are used to seeing
    front matter labelled with Roman numerals: i, ii, iii, iv, etc.; appendices prefixed
    with uppercase letters such as A.1, A.2, etc. or even chapter/page combinations
    such as 1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2. In PDF terminology this is what is referred to as
    a page label - an optional descriptive label of a page that is commonly presented
    on-screen. This is in contrast to the integer page index used internally in PDF
    files.'
