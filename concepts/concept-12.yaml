    A Hybrid-reference PDF file is a PDF 1.5 (or later) file containing objects
    referenced by standard cross-reference tables in addition to objects in
    object streams that are referenced by cross-reference streams. Only PDF 1.5
    and later files can be hybrid-reference PDFs because cross-reference streams
    were introduced in PDF 1.5. Refer to clause 7.5.8.4 Compatibility with
    applications that do not support compressed reference streams in ISO
    32000-2:2020.
