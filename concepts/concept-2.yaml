    Annotations are a special PDF feature most commonly associated with
    commenting and reviewing a document, such as highlighting text, text
    strikethrough, or sketching on top of a document. However PDF 2.0 defines 28
    different kinds of annotations which provide a far richer feature set
    including URLs (Link annotations), watermarks, form widgets, interactive 3D
    content, redaction, sound, movies and other rich media. For technical
    details see clause 12.5 in ISO 32000-2:2020.
