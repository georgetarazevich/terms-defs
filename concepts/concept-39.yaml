  definition: xref is a reserved PDF keyword used to identify the start of a conventional
    cross-reference table. It is also commonly used colloquially in place of the phrase
    "cross-reference". PDF 1.5 and later files that only use cross-reference streams
    do not use this keyword. PDF files that have incremental updates may have multiple
    instances of this keyword.
