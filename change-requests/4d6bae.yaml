          An action refers to PDF features that enable automatic behaviours
          triggered by a user interaction or event, such as displaying a
          different page in a document when a bookmark is clicked, performing a
          calculation with form data, or playing a sound or video.  For
          technical details see clause 12.6 in ISO 32000-2:2020.
