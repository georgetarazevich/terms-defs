  definition: "PDF versions are\_1.0,\_1.1,\_1.2,\_1.3,\_1.4,\_1.5,\_1.6,\_1.7\_and\_2.0, with each version defined by its own\_PDF specification document. PDF files are generally backwards- and forwards-compatible, enabling modern software to reliably display old PDFs. Every PDF file identifies it’s version via the first line file header\_%PDF-x.y, but may also update the version via a special key when an incremental update is applied. Later PDF versions define additional features."
