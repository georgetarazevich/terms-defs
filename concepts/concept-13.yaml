  definition: A PDF file can be updated incrementally without rewriting the entire
    file. When updating a PDF file incrementally, changes are appended to the end
    of the file, leaving the original contents unchanged. For example, a PDF-based
    document review tool may write PDF annotations as incremental updates, ensuring
    that a digitally signed original document is not invalidated by the adding of
    comments. Such technical details are typically not visible to end-users. For technical
    details see ISO 32000-2:2020.
