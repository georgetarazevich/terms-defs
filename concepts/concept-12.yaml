  definition: A Hybrid-reference PDF file is a PDF 1.5 (or later) file containing
    objects referenced by standard cross-reference tables in addition to objects in
    object streams that are referenced by cross-reference streams. Only PDF 1.5 and
    later files can be hybrid-reference PDFs because cross-reference streams were
    introduced in PDF 1.5. Refer to clause 7.5.8.4 Compatibility with applications
    that do not support compressed reference streams in ISO 32000-2:2020.
