  definition: "A PDF file can be updated incrementally without rewriting the entire file. When updating a PDF file incrementally, changes are appended to the end of the file, leaving the original contents unchanged. For example, a PDF-based document review tool may write PDF\_annotations\_as incremental updates, ensuring that a digitally signed original document is not invalidated by the adding of comments. Such technical details are typically not visible to end-users. For technical details see\_ISO 32000-2:2020."
