  definition: "Rolemaps are a core\_Tagged PDF\_concept that allows any structure type to be conceptually mapped between namespaces in a manner that enables all PDF processors to understand the basic intention of structure types. For example, a custom structure type called\_Foo\_might be rolemapped to a paragraph in the standard structure namespace, indicating that semantically\_Foo\_is \"best matched\" as a paragraph. Rolemaps thus support the use of custom structure types in PDF. Rolemaps and their use are described in clause 14.7 Logical structure and clause 14.8 Tagged PDF in ISO 32000."
