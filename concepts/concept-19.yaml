    Optical Character Recognition is the process of recognizing text from an
    image (photo) of text. It is typically referenced in relation to scan-to-PDF
    functionality. The accuracy of OCR results can vary depending on the quality
    of the page image and other factors. PDF does not constrain or limit OCR
    accuracy in any way.
